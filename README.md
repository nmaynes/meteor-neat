## A [Meteor](http://meteor.com) package of [Thoughtbot's](http://thoughtbot.com), Neat.

**A lightweight, semantic grid framework built on top of Bourbon**

---

Neat is a fluid grid framework built on [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) with the aim of being easy enough to use out of the box and flexible enough to customize down the road.

#### [Documentation & Demo](http://neat.bourbon.io)

#### [Changelog](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat/releases)

## Requirements

- [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) 3.3+
- [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) 3.1+

## Installation

Neat uses the [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org) package manager to easily generate a `neat` directory with all of the necessary files.

##Install

1. Make sure to add sass support to your meteor app:

  ```bash
  meteor add fourseven:scss
  ```

2. From within your Meteor app's directory:

  ```bash
  meteor add wolves:bourbon
  ```

3. From within your Meteor app's directory:

  ```bash
  meteor add wolves:neat
  ```

##Importing

1. Simply import Bourbon at the top of your sass file, then import bitters directly after it (*Currently working on configuring a way to provide a far less verbose import command*):

  ```scss
  @import ".meteor/local/build/programs/server/assets/packages/wolves_bourbon/bourbon"
  @import ".meteor/local/build/programs/server/assets/packages/wolves_neat/neat"
  ```
---

**Important Note** (*working on addressing this*)
Because Meteor will attempt to compile you app's local stylesheets prior to copying the server assets directory, the first time you run the app after installing the package your app will complain that it is unable to find it. For the moment this can be resolved by either stopping and restarting the app, at which point you should no longer get this error message, our running `touch` on you local stylesheet thats attempting to access the package, triggering a reload.


  It’s not recommended to add or modify the Neat files so that you can update them easily.

More information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat/wiki/Command-Line-Interface).

## Using Neat

First off, if you are planning to override the default grid settings (12 columns), it is recommended to create a `_grid-settings.scss` file for that purpose. Make sure to import it right *before* importing Neat:

```scss
@import ".meteor/local/build/programs/server/assets/packages/wolves_bourbon/bourbon"
@import "grid-settings";
@import ".meteor/local/build/programs/server/assets/packages/wolves_neat/neat"
```

In your newly created  `_grid-settings.scss`, import `neat-helpers` if you are planning to use `new-breakpoint()`, then define your new variables:

```scss
@import ".meteor/local/build/programs/server/assets/packages/wolves_neat/neat_helpers"

// Change the grid settings
$column: 90px;
$gutter: 30px;
$grid-columns: 10;
$max-width: em(1088);

// Define your breakpoints
$tablet: new-breakpoint(max-width 768px 8);
$mobile: new-breakpoint(max-width 480px 4);
```

See the [docs](http://neat.bourbon.io/docs/#variables) for a full list of settings.

Next, include the `outer-container` mixin in the topmost container (to which the `max-width` setting will be applied):

```scss
div.container {
  @include outer-container;
}
```

Then use `span-columns` on any element to specify the number of columns it should span:

```scss
div.element {
  @include span-columns(6);
}
```

If the element’s parent isn’t the top-most container, you need to add the number of columns of the parent element to keep the right proportions:

```scss
div.container {
  @include outer-container;

  div.parent-element {
    @include span-columns(8);

    div.element {
      @include span-columns(6 of 8);
    }
  }
}
```

To make your layout responsive, use the `media()` mixin to modify both the grid and the layout:

```scss
.my-class {
  @include media($mobile) { // As defined in _grid-settings.scss
    @include span-columns(2);
  }
}

// Compiled CSS
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  .my-class {
    display: block;
    float: left;
    margin-right: 7.42297%;
    width: 46.28851%; // 2 columns of the total 4 in this media context
  }
  .my-class:last-child {
    margin-right: 0;
  }
}
```

By setting `$visual-grid` to `true`, you can display the base grid in the background (default) or as an overlay. You can even change the color and opacity of the grid-lines by overriding the default settings as detailed in the section below.

The visual grid reflects the changes applied to the grid via the `new-breakpoint()` mixin, as long as the media contexts are defined *before* importing Neat.

## FAQ

#### How do I use `omega()` in a mobile-first workflow?

Using `omega()` with an `nth-child` pseudo selector in a mobile-first workflow will cause the style to be applied to wider-viewport media queries as well. That
is the cascading nature of CSS.

One solution would be to provide an `omega-reset()` mixin that negates the effect of `omega()` on that specific `nth-child` pseudo selector. While this is
often the most suggested solution, it is also a lazy hack that outputs ugly code and can quickly get out of hand in complex layouts. As a general rule, having to *undo* CSS styles is a sign of poor stylesheet architecture (more about [CSS code smells](http://csswizardry.com/2012/11/code-smells-in-css/)).

The other, more elegant, solution is to use mutually exclusive media queries, also referred to as [media-query
splitting](http://simurai.com/blog/2012/08/29/media-query-splitting). This would guarantee that `omega()` styles are only applied where desired.

```scss
$first-breakpoint-value: 400px;
$second-breakpoint-value: 700px;
$medium-viewport: new-breakpoint(min-width em($first-breakpoint-value) max-width em($second-breakpoint-value));
$large-viewport: new-breakpoint(min-width em($second-breakpoint-value + 1));

.element {
  @include media($medium-viewport) {
    @include span-columns(6);
    @include omega(2n);
  }

  @include media($large-viewport) {
    @include span-columns(4);
    @include omega(3n);
  }
}
```

If, for some reason, you still think that `omega-reset` is the only way you want to go, check out Josh Fry’s [omega-reset](http://joshfry.me/blog/2013/05/13/omega-reset-for-bourbon-neat).

#### Why are the elements not properly aligned with the visual grid?

The visual grid is built using CSS gradients whose stops might contain decimal values depending on the default settings of your grid. In order to render the gradient, browsers round the pixel values since they can’t deal with pixel fractions.

As a result the viusal grid might be few pixels off in some browsers. The result is also inconsistent across browsers. For best results, preview your website on Firefox as it renders closest to the expected outcome.

At this point, writing an internal rounding mechanism is not high priority.

#### Framework X has this feature that Neat seems to be missing. Can you add it?

Unless you [open a pull request](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat/compare/), the answer is most likely going to be no. Neat is lightweight and simple compared to other grid frameworks, and strives to remain so. We have plans for adding new features in future versions of the framework, but these will be most likely to support new ways of working with layouts on the Web, not patches to existing ones.
